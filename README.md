## Projects
**[What's a Midfielder Anyway](https://github.com/clintraye/Portfolio/tree/main/Whats_A_Midfielder).**
An evaluation of various clustering approaches as applied to in-game performance data for soccer players in Europes top 5 leagues. Analysis of resulting clusters as compared to players' labeled positions and how casual fans can apply insights resulting from novel clusters.

### Relevant Coursework

**Computational Data Analysis**
The course is designed to answer the most fundamental questions about machine learning: What are the most important methods to know about, and why? How can we answer the question 'is this method better than that one' using asymptotic theory? How can we answer the question 'is this method better than that one' for a specific dataset of interest? What can we say about the errors our method will make on future data? What's the 'right' objective function? What does it mean to be statistically rigorous? This course is designed to give graduate students a thorough grounding in the methods, theory, mathematics and algorithms needed to do research and applications in machine learning. The course covers topics from machine learning, classical statistics, and data mining.

**Regression Analysis**
Simple and multiple linear regression, inferences and diagnostics, stepwise regression and model selection.

**Data and Visual Analytics**
The course introduces students to analysis and visualization of complex high dimensional data. Both theory and applications will be covered including several practical case studies.

**Introduction for Computing for Data Analytics**
Computational techniques needed for data analysis; programming, accessing databases, multidimensional arrays, basic numerical computing, and visualization; hands-on applications and case studies.

**Introduction to Analytics Modeling**
Introduction to a wide variety of analytics models and techniques, including the basic ideas behind the models, experience using software to solve/analyze them, and case studies dealing with combining models to find a complete solution. Modeling approaches covered include classification, clustering, change detection, time series modeling, regression models, design of experiments, probability distributions, probability-based models and simulation, PCA, and optimization. Cross-cutting topics like data preparation, model validation, and variable selection are also covered. 

**Business Fundamentals for Analytics**
An accelerated introduction to the basics of management and the language of business. The course provides a framework that will enhance a person's effectiveness in the business world.
